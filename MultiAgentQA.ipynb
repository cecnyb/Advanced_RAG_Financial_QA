            "Answer: Air Products and Chemicals\n",
            "Response: The Operating Profit Margin for Air Products and Chemicals in 2014 was **18.7%**.\n",
            "\n",
            "For the printing papers business of International Paper Company in 2006, the exact Operating Profit Margin cannot be calculated directly from the available data since the specific operating profit for that segment is not provided. However, the segment had net sales of **$537 million**, and the overall operating profit for the company was **$677 million**. The documents indicate that operating profits for the printing papers segment were significantly higher than in 2005, suggesting a positive trend, but without precise figures, we cannot determine an exact margin.\n",
